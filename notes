https://askubuntu.com/questions/953334/how-does-the-history-command-work

history -a # save (append) the active shell's history (by default to ~/.bash_history)
history -w # save (overwrite) the active shell's history (by default to ~/.bash_history)
history -c # clear the active shell's history
history -d NNN # delete row NNN of the active shell's history
history -r # reload the active shell's history (by default from ~/.bash_history)


a file ~/.bash_history.$$ is created for every session. $$ is shell's pid.
every time a shell command is issued __reload_history__ is called (guess first time it's called, it created that .bash_history.$$) 

as shell commands are issues, they all get added to the file .bash_history.$$
on shell seesion exit __merge_history_file is called and it appends content of .bash_history.$$ to .bash_history



issue with 'shrinked since it was backed up' - 

for the sake of below example let's assume a size limit for each file is 5 lines.

below an initial 'history' file. no 'history.bak' exists.

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee


then a bash session gets started. 2 commands get issued - 'cd' and 'ls'. session exits.
we end up with 'history' and 'history.bak' files. Content as follows.

history

ls
cd
cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee


history.back

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee


then if a new sessions gets started, it'll complain that 'History file ".bash_history" shrinked since it was backed up.'


TODO
make use of
filter_bash_history



# useful alias for testing
# alias tes='source smart-bash-history/filtering.sh; rm -f tesci*; echo "#1234567890" > tescik; echo "ls" >> tescik; echo "#0987654321" >> tescik; echo "cd" >> tescik ; '
